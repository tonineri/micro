## Getting Started

To use the **micro** base image, you can pull it from Docker Hub and use it as the base for your own Dockerfiles.

```dockerfile
FROM antonioneri/micro:latest
# Add your application setup here
```

## Logging

Micro uses `syslog-ng` for logging combined with `logrotate`. The configuration is optimized for Docker environments, ensuring logs are properly managed and rotated.

### Syslog-ng

`syslog-ng` configuration can be found in [syslog-ng.conf](/container/services/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf).

### Logrotate

`logrotate` configuration can be found in [logrotate.conf](/container/services/syslog-ng/logrotate). Current configuration:

- Rotates logs **weekly**
- Keeps **4 weeks** of backlogs
- **Creates** new logs after rotating old ones
